<b>NOTE</b>

The code is very disorganized and sticks together to cover each other's bugs, the logic isn't great either.

I will not continue this because this project is only for me to practice when I am new to reactjs. Next time I'll probably make a similar project and of course the logic will be better than this with the skills I've learned.
